FINALIZING SEQUENCERUN -- SUMMARY
*********************************
For all runs, the sum of surface components has not changed more than 8.8817841970e-14%

For all runs, no surface concentrations were found lower than 0.0000000000e+00

For all runs, no absolute surface differentials were found higher than 0.0000000000e+00 (at 0.0000000000e+00K)

For all runs, no relative surface differentials were found higher than 5.8425827274e-12 (at 5.7315000000e+02K)
