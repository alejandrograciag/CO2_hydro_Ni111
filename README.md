# CO2_hydro_Ni111

This repository contains the inputs (kMC simulations) and both inputs and outputs (MkM simulations) for the CO2 hydrogenation over Ni(111) study entitled: "CO2 Hydrogenation on Ni(111): Microkinetic Modelling vs. Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations – Choosing the right approach for unravelling reaction kinetics". (doi: xxxxxxxxxxxx)

These files contain the kinetic data of all the 86 elementary processes studied at different conditions (T = 573.15 K and 673.15 K and P = 1 and 10 bar) as well as the produced macroscopic properties for MkM simulations. The files are grouped following their Temperature and Pressure conditions first, kinetic approach second and mechanistic specifications third:

- **CO2_hydro** → The mechanism contains the 86 elementary processes.
- **condition i** → Desorption of CO is inhibited.
- **condition ii** → Desorption of both CO and CH₂O are inhibited.
